# 🤖 VIRTUAL-ASSISTANT 🤖

### 🔶 One of my best completely self-built from scratch projects 🔶

>### This Project is the Virtual Assistant that's been created by using Libraries and end-to-end Customization

### ***`"Livvy"`*** is the name of my Assistant and does whatever you ask her to do!!

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION ✅

Once the program is run, the microphone gets activated to listen to the voice commands.
The assistant gets activated only when the name assigned to her is called, otherwise it doesn’t respond.

## 🧊 WORKING 🧊

### When the program executes the mic is enabled and is waiting for the user’s input for the name of the assistant to activate it. There are three possible outcomes:
***✒️  If no input, assistant asks politely for input***
\
***✒️ If the input is wrong, assistant reminds the user to call out it’s name***
\
***✒️ If the input is correct the assistant is activated*** 

<br>
